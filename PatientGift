Write a Java program that checks if a patientâ€™s age is between 18 and 65 (inclusive) to determine vaccine eligibility. If eligible, verify that their appointment number is a 3-digit number and check if it is even to assign a priority slot; otherwise, assign a regular slot. Then, print a gift based on the last digit of the appointment number using a switch statement: print "Gift: Pen"
Code:
 import java.util.Scanner;
 public class PatientGift
 {
     public static void main(String[] args)
 {
     Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
     int lastDigit,digitsCount=0;
     System.out.println("Enter the Patient's Age:");
     int age= scan.nextInt();
     if(age>=18&&age<=65) {
         System.out.print("The patient is Eligible for vaccine");
         System.out.print("Enter the Appointment number:");
         int appointmentNumber = scan.nextInt();
         lastDigit = appointmentNumber % 10;
         while (appointmentNumber != 0) {
             appointmentNumber /= 10;
             digitsCount++;
         }
         if (digitsCount == 3)
         {
             if (lastDigit % 2 == 0) {
                 System.out.println("you are Assigned a Priority Slot");
             } else {
                 System.out.println("you are Assigned a Regular Slot");
             }
             switch (lastDigit) {
                 case 1:
                     System.out.println("Gift:pen");
                     break;
                 case 2:
                 System.out.println("Gift:Mask");
                     break;
                 case 3:
                     System.out.println("Gift: Sanitizer");
                     break;
                 default:
                     System.out.println("No Special Gift!");
             }
         }
     }
     else {
         System.out.println("you are not Eligible for Vaccine. \nYour age should be within 18-65");
     }
    }
 }
Output:
Enter the Patient's age:34
The Patient is Eligible for vaccine
Enter the Appointment number:442
you are assigned a Priority slot
Gift:Mask
Enter the Patient's age:14
you are not Eligible for vaccine
your age should be within 18-16.
